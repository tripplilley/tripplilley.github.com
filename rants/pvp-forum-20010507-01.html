      It's funny, this reminds me of a conversation I was having with
      a CS freshman (or maybe sophomore) a couple of weeks ago at
      gaming night. I was sitting around, drawing data structures so I
      could visualize them. He came up and said "ugh, structure
      charts. I hate those."
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Me: "well, actually, they're not structure charts, they're
	data structure diagrams, which are different. But why do you
	hate structure charts?"
      </p>

      <p>
	Him: "They're unnecessary. I can carry it all in my head."
      </p>

      <p>
	Me: "Ah. I see. Tell me, have you ever coded anything outside of school?"
      </p>

      <p>
	Him: "No."
      </p>

      <p>
	Me: "Ah. I see."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      See, he was saying basically the same thing, only about a
      different subject. His belief was that structure charts were
      useless because he'd never had to work on anything where they
      were truly meaningful, and where they helped him to visualize an
      immense and complex system, and by visualizing, helped him to
      understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      He also missed the point that doing structure charts on small,
      trivial projects was an exercise. Exercises are designed to
      improve something: skills, muscles, breathing efficiency,
      whatever. People training for marathons start out running around
      the block, and work up to running around the city.
    </p>

    <p>
      In that sense, dating is an exercise. It's where you learn how
      to deal with other people socially, and most importantly,
      intimately. When you're out spending twenty-five bucks on movie
      tickets, popcorn, and overpriced flavoured water, you're really
      learning how to communicate with another person on a deeper
      level. Sure, going to the movies is a baby step, but there's the
      car ride after the movies, or the hanging out on the front porch
      talking, making out, whatever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, you graduate to college, and from there to what
      everyone else calls "the real world" (I hate that. High school
      and college are real, too). Anyway, the point is that you will
      probably start to realize, when the code gets huge and the
      feature list keeps growing, that you really need some structure
      charts. Or UML. Or whatever. You need to visualize it. And those
      exercises pay off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, you'll start to realize that the world is a really
      <i>hard</i> place to live, grow, and thrive! And you'll start to
      realize that working <i>together</i> is the best way to pull it
      off. And eventually you'll realize that working as closely as
      you can stand with your true soulmate is the most rewarding (and
      most efficient) way to pull it off.
    </p>

    <p>
      That doesn't mean you'll never again write code without a
      structure chart. It doesn't mean you won't go out to the movies
      alone sometime, or kiss another pretty girl (or boy). It means
      that you'll figure out, as you go, why these things <i>can</i>
      be important. The only way to figure it out is to try things out
      and see what brings you joy, and how you can best share that
      joy. As the motto of Callahan's Crosstime Saloon says:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>Shared pain is lessened; shared joy is increased.</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      (As a side-note, I'm getting married in eighteen days. It took
      me a lot of mistake-making to figure it out, but <i>I</i>, for
      one, see the value of structure charts.)
