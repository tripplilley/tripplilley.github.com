	Serious about your frustration with the RIAA and corporatism
	in general? Try <a
	href="http://www.actupny.org/documents/CDdocuments/CDindex.html">Civil
	Disobedience</a>. No, really. Be willing to get arrested for
	possessing the tools we take for granted. I am. But read on...
      </p>

      <p>
	First, a summary, since this is long and will get chopped:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <b>We can't win if we look like the bad guys.</b> Therefore,
	  we must clean up our act, both public and private, and be
	  willing to address the <i>real</i>, underlying concerns of
	  our fellow artists and consumers.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>Corporations don't trust individuals; individuals don't
	  trust corporations.</b> Therefore, we must gather all of the
	  individuals <i>together</i> on our side, artists and
	  consumers alike, instead of allowing the corporations to
	  divide us.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>The future is change; everyone is scared.</b> The
	  industry is afraid, but also opportunistic. It believes it
	  can secure a future for itself built by legally forcing
	  nature to behave itself. It attacks the fears of consumers
	  to create this legal impetus.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>The "Tragedy of the Commons" is worrisome.</b> Individual
	  artists are afraid that if they open themselves up to a
	  meritocracy, they'll be raped. We have counterexamples, and
	  we also need to set expectations.
	</li>
      </ul>


      <font size="+1"><b>We can't win if we look like the bad guys</b></font>
      <p>
	Before you don your <a
	href="http://www.copyleft.net/item.phtml?page=product_276_front.phtml">DeCSS
	Shirt</a>, it's important that we get our act together and
	learn the very powerful art of <b><i>spin</i></b>. Don't sneer
	and say that's beneath us. Right now, the RIAA and MPAA are
	mobilizing a very powerful political engine. They are engaging
	in a classic tactic, painting our community's members as
	pirates and criminals in the public's eye. It's our job to
	<i>spin</i> right back at them, to recast the debate in terms
	that make <i>us</i> clearly the good guys, and <i>them</i>
	clearly the <b>corporate Goliath</b>, out to <b>trample</b>
	the <b>rights</b> of individual <b>artists and consumers.</b>
	Here's how...
      </p>

      <p>
	<i>Start</i> giving <b>props to artists.</b> <i>Start</i>
	decrying the fact that there's no widely available, secure,
	trustable infrastructure for "tipping". <i>Start</i> pitting
	the labels against the individual artists, whom you
	<i>would</i> compensate directly, if there were a reliable
	means to do so. <i>Blame</i> the <b>corporate hegemony</b> for
	this situation. Traditional corporations exist for one reason
	alone: <b><i>profit</i></b>; profit to the exclusion of all
	else, including the rights of artists, and the rights of
	individual consumers. <i>Start</i> pitting the labels against
	consumers, by using inflammatory phrases like <b>"abrogation
	of our rights"</b> and "corporate hegemony" (please understand
	what they mean and be able to <b>defend them calmly,</b>
	though). As soon as we can swing the focus of our fellow
	consumers' mistrust and cynicism to the industry, as soon as
	we can paint ourselves the David in this battle, <b>we will
	begin changing things.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
	The reasons for this are simple:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  <b>People root for the underdog.</b> Right now, the RIAA and
	  MPAA are painting themselves and the artists as the underdog
	  against the massive, unstoppable tide of digital piracy and
	  mayhem. As it happens, they may be right, but I'll get to
	  that in a minute.
	</li>

	<li>
	  <b>People fear for their own property.</b> People want to be
	  "secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects". The
	  RIAA and MPAA are casting this debate squarely in terms of
	  <i>theft</i> of <i>property</i> because they know that will
	  strike a chord with the public. They want you, the consumer,
	  to believe that, if you don't side with them to stop Napster
	  and DeCSS, you'll lose out just as much as if someone broke
	  into your house and stole all of your CDs.
	</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>
	My freshman year in college, someone stole 250 CDs from my
	dorm room. 250 CDs that I had worked very hard to afford, and
	had worked very hard to acquire (many rare imports, anime,
	etc.). I felt hurt, violated, confused, angry, and all of
	that. The RIAA and MPAA are trying to connect with those
	feelings in the consumer public.
      </p>
    
      <p>
	We need to be going for the same connection, while also making
	the connection between individual freedom and liberty. We need
	to make it clear that we're all for just compensation, and
	that we don't need Goliath's hand to ensure that
	compensation. We need to show our fellow consumers that the
	industry is just in the game for the sake of <b>revenue</b>,
	and that they don't give a damn about <b>consumer rights</b>,
	nor do they <b>trust</b> consumers in the least. Yet they ask
	for our trust that they will justly compensate artists, that
	they will respect our rights to fair use, that they will treat
	us as equals (IANAL, but a corporation is legally considered a
	person.)
      </p>


      <font size="+1"><b>Corporations don't trust individuals; individuals don't trust
      corporations</b></font>
      <p>
	The RIAA and MPAA would have you believe that every artist and
	"legitimate consumer" out there is on their side, and that
	everyone else is a pirate. We know that's wrong, but what do
	we do about it?
      </p>

      <p>
	<b>Get all the individuals on the same side.</b> Artists are
	individuals. Consumers are individuals. Everything in between
	the two is corporate infrastructure. The internet makes that
	corporatism irrelevant to the kind of relationships we could
	be building with our fellow individuals.
      </p>

      <p>
	If I play your song, and I like it, <b>I'll give you a
	tip.</b> If I play it all the damned time, I'll give you big
	tips, frequently. If Metallica pulled their heads out, they'd
	understand that they'd make a lot more from me letting me tip
	them than they are right now, since I won't buy anything new
	of theirs (even though I <b>really <i>want</i> to</b>).
      </p>


      <font size="+1"><b>The future is change; everyone is scared</b></font>
      <p>
	Things we've taken for granted, as a society, as individuals,
	and as corporations, are all in the process of changing
	dramatically and radically. Specifically, traditional notions
	of <b>property</b> become more meaningless with each passing
	day. We know how to treat tangible items as property (you're
	stealing it if you deprive me of it without my consent), but
	we don't know how to treat intangibles as property; after all,
	if you copy it from me, how are you depriving me of it?
      </p>

      <p>
	And if you think that distinction is cut-and-dried, and that
	it just means we need two classes of property, intellectual
	and tangible, think again. What's going to happen in a decade
	or three when <b>nano-technology</b> makes tangible property
	available to anyone with a handful of garbage, a replicator,
	and a design?
      </p>

      <p>
	Now, it's understandable that corporations might be
	afraid. After all, <b>they might disappear.</b> Or have to
	reinvent themselves radically. I think they're pretty well
	aware of that fact. The issue, ultimately, is one of
	<b>control</b>. The industry wants to <b>control</b> its
	destiny, but it doesn't have that kind of power. It seeks to
	create that power, artificially, by lobbying to create laws
	like the DMCA, that <b>curtail individual rights</b> that are
	far more powerful than they were when they were granted, 225
	years ago, before there was an Internet.
      </p>

      <p>
	I don't know about you, but I don't want to <b>be
	controlled</b> by a corporation. I want the <b>freedom</b> to
	interact with my fellow individuals, to <b>share</b> and
	<b>communicate</b> and <b>transact</b> by our own rules. I
	want to write code and <b>trust</b> that you'll
	<b>compensate</b> me for it justly. And I do. Literally. I
	have a <b>100% GPL</b> clause for the work I do. And I
	<b>trust</b> the community and individuals to be faithful to
	one another, and to support one another. I don't need a law or
	a corporation to <b>enforce</b> what ought to be <b>human
	decency.</b>
      </p>


      <font size="+1"><b>The "Tragedy of the Commons" is worrisome</b></font>
      <p>
	The idea that <b>some people will steal all the goodies</b> is
	worrisome. <b>They can't.</b> Unlike the commons about which
	"The Tragedy of the Commons" was written, <b>you can't trample
	up the grass around an artist.</b> You can't turn a director
	into mud by copiously copying her work.
      </p>

      <p>
	You <i>can</i> refrain from contributing to their
	livelihood. You <i>can</i> enjoy their work and simply not tip
	them, even though you can afford to tip them. Fine. We already
	have a really good term for that in place: <font
	color="#FF0000"><b>cheap asshole.</b></font> Perhaps we could
	get it made into a legal term?
      </p>

      <p>
	Anyway, there are natural responses to the problem of the
	<font color="#FF0000"><b>cheap asshole.</b></font> The first
	is <b>the pillory,</b> metaphorically speaking. A good tipping
	infrastructure will allow you to leave your tips either
	anonymously or with credit. An <a
	href="http://www.advogato.org/">advogato</a>-like <a
	href="http://www.advogato.org/trust-metric.html"><b>trust
	metric</b></a> will allow folks to rate your generosity in
	comparison to your means. A well-deployed
	<b>micro-accounting</b> infrastructure will make artists,
	producers, technicians, and so forth, <b>accountable</b> for
	how they spend the tips in pursuit of their art. All of that
	means that <font color="#FF0000"><b>assholes will be
	highlighted in red</b></font>, and the object of public scorn.
      </p>

      <p>
	This is as it should be, and there is a long tradition of such
	treatment. Read <i>A Christmas Carol</i> if you doubt
	me. Everyone hated <font color="#FF0000"><b>Scrooge</b></font>
	because he was... well, you know. A <font
	color="#FF0000"><b>c.a.</b></font>
      </p>

      <p>
	The second is based on what I call <b>"laws of information
	  physics".</b> The two fundamental laws of information physics
	are:
      </p>

      <ol>
	<li>
	  <b>
	    Bandwidth between any two points at any given time is a
	    finite resource.
	  </b>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>
	    Information flows freely as long as there is available
	    bandwidth.
	  </b>
	</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
	These laws can be exploited to prevent the <font
	color="#FF0000"><b>c.a.'s</b></font> from propagating:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>
	  First of all, imagine if you had to <b>pay</b> for bandwidth
	  by your usage. Hey, if we're not relying on <b>king
	  corporation</b> any more, someone's got to foot the bill for
	  your 128Kbps chunk of the OC48 to <a
	  href="http://gratefuldead.com/">gratefuldead.com</a>. Thus,
	  when you download directly from them, there's a mandatory
	  tip of $.05/MB ($3.00 for a 60MB album). You'd still want to
	  tip on top of that <b>if you <i>liked</i> it;</b> that was
	  just to cover their connectivity. Of course, they may be
	  <b>popular enough,</b> and get tipped enough as it is, <b>to
	  not charge</b> that connectivity fee.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Imagine if free file-sharing networks allowed you to hook
	  into the aforementioned <a
	  href="http://www.advogato.org/trust-metric.html">trust-metric</a>,
	  and determine based on that whether or not you would allow
	  your server to send files to a <font
	  color="#FF0000"><b>c.a.</b></font> Through literal
	  <b>peer-pressure,</b> people would find themselves either
	  tipping liberally, or <b>cut off</b> from the goods.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Such infrastructure can be exploited in a lot of other ways
	that bring back our ability to <b>trust one another,</b> and
	to <b>build community</b> even in the massive scale of the
	Internet and a global economy. People who've had hard times
	could "get a break." Or if you're a real hard-liner about
	people overcoming circumstance, you could set your own metrics
	to shun anyone who claimed hard times, or anyone who was rich
	without working for it, and not generous with their
	wealth. <b>"The possibilities,"</b> as they say, <b>"are
	limitless."</b>
      </p>

      <font size="+1"><b>Getting there from here</b></font>
      <p>
	I'd recap, but you can scroll to the top for that. The bottom
	line is that we need to pay attention to the <b>fears</b> and
	<b>concerns</b> of our fellow individuals, and <b>address
	those</b>, and not just go spouting off about how we're going
	to do whatever we please and the industry can't stop us. We
	all believe the industry can't stop us, because ultimately, we
	can hide. <b>But who wants to hide?</b> And who wants a world
	in which <b>sharing is a criminal act?</b> So don't feed their
	fire. Help your fellow artists, consumers, individuals
	<b>understand</b> how we can build a better future together,
	without corporate hegemony.
      </p>
    
      <p>
	And be prepared to <a
	href="http://napsterdiscuss.weblogs.com/stories/storyReader$48">get
	arrested</a> in the meantime. But when you do, make sure you
	come off sane, rational, and reasonable. Make it clear that
	<b>the man is putting you down.</b> If you're not <b>calm,
	careful, and likable,</b> your fellow consumers and artists
	are going to see exactly what the RIAA and MPAA want them to
	see. And <b>away goes your freedom and their freedom.<b>
      </p>
