      I'm following in the footsteps of an earlier poster in saying that I'm
      disappointed to see Apple and NeXT's best and brightest come up
      with... a file browser. I'm just as disappointed as I was five years
      ago when I signed up to be one of the first fifteen-hundred BeBox
      developers, after I discovered what their idea of "revolutionizing"
      the operating system was.

      To quote Alan Cooper, from <i>About Face: The Essentials of User
	Interface Design</i>:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <i>
	Even though the file system is an internal facility that
	shouldn't--by all rights--even affect the user, it creates a
	large problem because the influence of the file system on the
	interface of most programs is very deep. The most intractable
	problems facing user interface designers usually concern the
	file system and its demands. It affects our menus, our
	dialogs, even the procedural framework of our programs, and
	this influence is likely to continue indefinitely unless we
	make a concerted effort to stop it.
      </i>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      <i>
	Currently, most software treats the file system in much the
	same way that the operating system shell does (Explorer, File
	Manager). <b>This is tantamount to you dealing with your car
	  the same way your mechanic does.</b> Even though this
	approach is tragically bad, it is an established, de facto
	standard and there is considerable resistance to improving it.
      </i>

      Fundamentally, I'm a bit tired of hearing about how everyone's
      "revolutionizing" everything, when they're really
      <i>not</i>. Look: <a
      href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=revolution">revolution</a>
      and <a
      href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=revolutionize">revolutionize</a>
      both imply "sudden, radical, or complete change". The American
      colonies didn't fight the Revolutionary War to install a local
      king. The French Revolution wasn't so they could hire a newer,
      prettier cake-eater.

      The file system, fundamentally, is an implementation
      detail. It's an artifact of how "things have always been
      done". It's a drag on doing real, substantive improvement to the
      way computers work <i>for</i> people. There are millions of
      people out there who have <i>never</i> used a computer, and have
      yet to learn. They don't <i>need</i> to learn what a filesystem
      is, or to navigate it. They need to be able to <i>find</i> and
      <i>use</i> the information and tools that are important to them,
      period.

      If we truly want to <i>revolutionize</i> the user interface, the
      user experience, etc., then we really need to start with a more
      fundamental re-thinking of how things work. Some of the ideas
      Miguel de Icaza outlined in his <a
      href="http://www.helixcode.com/~miguel/bongo-bong.html">Let's
      Make Unix Not Suck</a> talk/paper are a good starting place. The
      universal presence of an ORB, lots of small tools cooperating
      via the ORB <i>interactively</i>, are all good kicks in the
      pants of the Unix mindset. But, fundamentally, that's nothing
      more than what Redmond is doing with COM*, etc. There's more
      work to be done. There's ripping out the filesystem as a
      mechanism for data storage and retrieval, and replacing it with
      a <a href="http://www.framerd.org/">dynamic semantic
      network</a>, allowing <i>information</i> storage and retrieval
      (don't confuse <i>data</i> and <i>information</i>). There's
      moving away from skins and into real, powerful,
      direct-manipulation user interfaces. For those of you that
      remember OS/2 and IBM's System Object Model, there was some
      very, <i>very</i> powerful technology underneath all of that!
      Hell, you <i>still</i> can't reliably drag a document over top
      of the printer and have it "do the right thing" in Windows or
      Linux like you could in OS/2. And that was CORBA all over the
      place, too, so there was plenty of room for those services to
      make their way out over the network.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't even get me started on package management and installation
      management, or system administration. Suffice it to say that
      very little of our technology is <i>designed</i> to help us
      achieve our goals. It's a lot of work, but this community has
      boundless energy, and the opportunity and environment to do
      things that are <i>truly</i> revolutionary. We revolutionized
      the development model, now let's revolutionize the technology.
