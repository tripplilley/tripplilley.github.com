      and knowledge, in the pursuit of personal and professional
      growth and positive change.
		</p>

    <h2>Career Summary</h2>
    <p>
      As a general technologist, I&apos;ve acquired an expansive body of
      skills, experience, and knowledge of technologies,
      methodologies, and problem domains. I&apos;ve delved deeply into the
      unique problems of, and principle technologies behind:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Systems support and infrastructure for software development and deployment</li>
      <li>Digital Multimedia, graphic design and prepress</li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Since my start in the industry in 1989, I&apos;ve dedicated myself to
      understanding problem domains, technologies, and the human
      factors issues that bridge those two worlds. In the intervening
      decade and a half of work, I&apos;ve acquired a unique and thorough
      blend of experiences with systems, solutions, and the business
      problems to which the solutions apply.
    </p>


    <h2>Functional Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I&apos;ve been a software developer, systems and infrastructure
      architect, and general technologist, de facto human factors
      consultant, graphic designer, and support technician. I
      understand technology from the lowest levels to the highest, and
      am comfortable operating at any and all of those levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have exceptional talents for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Analysis, pattern discovery, and synthesis</li>
      <li>System architecture</li>
      <li>Human and computer language (especially metaphor and analogy)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I have specific skills in, and passions for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure software (i.e., software in support of other technological ends)</li>
      <li>Visual design and layout, in both traditional and electronic media</li>
      <li>Data mining, especially scrubbing and cleansing, and reverse-engineering</li>
      <li>Software frameworks (i.e., rationalizing code into libraries, toolsets, etc.)</li>
      <li>Bridging technology gaps (e.g., inter-language integration)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Programming Skills</h2>
    <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
    <p class="groupdesc">
      I list these in three groups. In the first group are those
      languages in which I have achieved mastery and worked
      &ldquo;deep black magic.&rdquo; I list them in reverse
      chronological order of my initial experience with them (which
      roughly approximates the order of my mastery and adoption of
      each of them as my language of choice, although in several cases
      there is significant overlap.)
    </p>

    <ul class="group">
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>JavaScript <em>(with emphasis on prototype-based OOP features)</em></li>
      <li>Perl</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>MC68HC11 Assembly</li>
      <li>Visual Basic</li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>C</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="groupdesc">
      In the second group are those languages with which I have
      achieved familiarity and the ability to accomplish functional
      work, but have not had occasion or specific reason to explore in
      more depth. I list these in reverse order of my skill level with
      them (greatest to least.)
    </p>

    <ul class="group">
      <li>Jython <em>(Python implemented in Java)</em></li>
      <li>Emacs LISP / LISP / AutoLISP</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="groupdesc">
      In the third group are those languages with which I have a
      conceptual familiarity and have written &ldquo;toy&rdquo;
      programs to exercise concepts, but have not written significant
      code, or even short, task-specific programs. I group these
      (roughly) by language type:
    </p>

    <ul class="group">
      <li>Self, CLOS, Prolog</li>
      <li>Z80 Assembly <em>(have reverse-engineered from machine code)</em></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Other Languages</h3>
    <p class="groupdesc">
      These are purpose-specific languages which, even when
      <em>Turing-complete</em>, are narrow in their scope. I group
      these (roughly) by type and purpose, but the groups are
      otherwise unordered.
    </p>

    <ul class="group">
      <li><strong>Generalized Markup:</strong> SGML, XML, YAML</li>
      <li><strong>Stylesheets and Layout:</strong> PostScript , CSS1, CSS2+Positioning, XSLT + XSL-FO</li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Technology Skills</h2>
    <h3>Software Environment and Infrastructure Technologies</h3>

    <p class="groupdesc">
      Here I include technologies I view as a part of the deployment
      &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in which software runs, including the
      infrastructure upon which the software is based. I group these
      by technology family, and within each group, list its members
      in chronological order of my initial exposure to them.
    </p>
    <ul class="group">
      <li><strong>IPC/RPC:</strong> Sockets, DCE-RPC, COM/DCOM, CORBA IIOP, Java RMI, XML-RPC, REST</li>
      <li><strong>Filesharing:</strong> SMB/CIFS, NFS, WebDAV <em>(at the protocol level)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Data Persistence:</strong> Flat-file, RDBMS, Semantic Net, BTrieve/DBM, OO, ORDBMS, XML</li>
      <li><strong>UI:</strong> CLI, Text-mode windowing, GUI, Web forms, Web-based DHTML+JavaScript, Flash</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software Development Infrastructure Technologies</h3>
    <p class="groupdesc">
      Here I include the technologies I view as a part of the process
      of building software. This includes specific compiler suites,
      toolchains, etc. This list is not exhaustive, but indicative. I
      group these by tool family, and within each group, list its
      members by my rating of their worth in solving the problem
      (greatest to least.)
    </p>
    <ul class="group">
      <li><strong>Source Management:</strong> Perforce SCM, Subversion, CVS, RCS</li>
      <li><strong>Dependancy Management:</strong> GNU Make, MS nmake</li>
      <li><strong>Compilation/Toolchain:</strong> GCC+GNU toolchain, Borland C/C++, MS Visual C/C++</li>
      <li><strong>Parsing/Lexing:</strong> ANTLR, PCCTS, Flex+Bison, Lex+YACC</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operating Systems / Platforms</h3>
    <p class="groupdesc">
      Here I include the hardware and software platforms on which
      everything runs, including &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; platforms
      implemented on top of other environments.
    </p>
    <ul class="group">
      <li><strong>Hardware Platforms:</strong> Intel-based PC (from 8086 ISA through current technology, including PC104(+)), Motorola 68k-based Macintosh, PowerPC-based Macintosh, Sun SPARC-based workstations (5, 20, Ultra), Palm, Sony Cli&eacute;, custom embedded platforms</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>General Productivity Applications and Technologies</h3>
    <p class="groupdesc">
      It ought to go without saying that, as a seasoned software
      developer, I know my way around just about any piece of software
      into which I come into contact. However, every package has its
      idiosyncrasies, so it&apos;s important to know just which ones I use
      regularly enough to call myself &ldquo;skilled&rdquo; in them.
    </p>
    <ul class="group">
      <li><strong>Office Suites:</strong> Microsoft Office (through 2003, including XML), WordPerfect Office (through 10), StarOffice / OpenOffice 2.x (including XML)</li>

            <em>Ghost</em>-like tool to install hard drive images over
            the network. <em>CASPER</em> was, effectively, my first
            true Linux embedding project, since it ran off of a set of
            Linux floppies for creating and retrieving disk images.

            In support of the dynamic nature of the website,
            implemented a Perl module to support Prototype-based
            OOP. The library made extensive use of Perl grey-magic
            (AUTOLOAD, closures, subroutine references, parameters as
            a list, etc.)

            In early 1997, part of a three-person team that built a
            Java/CORBA based order and inventory management system to
            replace their existing Mac-based product. Worked with
            bleeding edge Linux Java implementation and Early Access
            Java CORBA tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personally built a Java/CORBA middleware system to wrap
            all access to persistent storage. A preprocessor expanded
            extension keywords to the Java language to build
            infrastructure for persistent and distributed objects.

            Perl.
          </li>
          <li>
            As part of <em>KATHMANDU</em>, developed
            visualization tools to show relationships among addressing
            entities on the network, including technology
            relationships and financial / business relationships
            (e.g., maps between booths and equipment

          <li>
            In support of <em>KATHMANDU</em> work,
            refined the Perl Prototype library, and added an implicit

            configuration of PointGuard Access Control and Alarm
            panels (based on Echelon LonWorks technology). This

          <li>
            Designed and implemented UI for PC based configuration of
            the RCC/DDC series of alarm panels (MC68k-based embedded
            systems). This involved building a C++ database engine to
            run out of ROM on the 68k board. That means I know what an
            <em>&ldquo;in-place new&rdquo;</em> is.

          <li>
            Designed and built GPIB and embedded-systems based
            automated test equipment for components in the Longbow
            targeting system on the Apache helicopter. Discovered,
            analysed, and solved discrepancies in the timing
            assumptions made by the original designs. This project
            involved hardware design (around the Motorola 68HC11 8-bit
            microcontroller and the North Atlantic Angle Position
            Indicator), MC68HC11 assembler, a C++ OLE Automation
